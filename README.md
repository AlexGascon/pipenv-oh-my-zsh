## Pipenv plugin - Oh My Zsh!
This repository contains a plugin to ease the use of pipenv in the [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) shell.

This plugin is not (yet) merged to the main oh-my-zsh repository, so you have to set it up manually if you want to use it. To do it, follow these steps:

1) Create a `pipenv` folder in your `~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins` directory
2) Copy there the file `pipenv.plugin.zsh`
3) Add `pipenv` to the `plugins` list in your `.zshrc` file.
